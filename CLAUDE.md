## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

## Project: Kontrola Trasówek (10x Astro Starter)

Scaffolded via `/10x-bootstrapper` from the `10x-astro-starter` template
(Astro + Supabase + Cloudflare). This section carries the project-specific
guidance the starter shipped with — merged in by hand after the scaffold's
own `CLAUDE.md.scaffold` was reviewed, since it did not overwrite the toolkit
block above.

### Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- `npm run smoke` — dependency-free auth-flow smoke test (`scripts/smoke.mjs`) against a running server, `BASE_URL` env (default `http://localhost:4321`). Run after dependency upgrades; CI runs it against the production preview with a local Supabase.

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

### Architecture

**Astro 7 SSR app** with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

#### Rendering mode

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages are server-rendered by default. API routes must export `const prerender = false`.

#### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates a Supabase SSR client using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. Uses `astro:env/server` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (server-only secrets declared in astro.config.mjs `env.schema`).
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the current user, attaches to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Protected pages: `src/pages/reports/{index,[id]}.astro` (the starter's `dashboard.astro` stub was removed once real protected pages existed)

#### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).
- **Astro components** for static content/layout; **React components** only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind class merging**: use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional/merged class names. Do not concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components live in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style variant. Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **API routes**: use uppercase `GET`, `POST` exports. No validation library is wired in yet (`zod` is not a dependency) — auth handlers read `formData.get(...)` directly; don't assume zod exists.
- **Supabase migrations**: no `supabase/migrations/` directory exists yet — this starter only uses Supabase Auth's built-in `auth.users` table, no custom tables. When you add the first table, create `supabase/migrations/` with `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` naming and enable RLS with granular per-operation, per-role policies from the start.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client" etc.). Extract hooks to `src/hooks/` (matches the `@/hooks` alias in `components.json`).
- **Services/helpers** go in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types** (entities, DTOs): no `src/types.ts` exists yet — it's the intended location once shared types are needed, not an existing file.
- No test framework is configured (no vitest/jest/playwright). `npm run smoke` is a dependency-free sanity script, not a substitute for real tests — add a framework deliberately when needed.
- Dependency versions are intentionally bleeding-edge: TypeScript `^6.0.3`, ESLint `^10.10.0`, `lucide-react` `^1.14.0` — don't "fix" these thinking they're typos. `eslint-plugin-react` is wrapped with `fixupPluginRules` in `eslint.config.js` since it doesn't yet natively support ESLint 10's context API.

#### Environment

- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev)
- Both vars are declared `optional: true` in the `astro:env` schema — the app degrades gracefully (see `src/lib/config-status.ts`) rather than hard-failing when unset.
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Cloudflare local dev: secrets go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler` auth)

### CI

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has two jobs on every push/PR to master: `ci` (`npx astro sync` → `npm run lint` → `npx astro check` → `npm run build`, using `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` repo secrets) and `smoke` (spins up local Supabase via CLI, builds, `npm run preview`, then `npm run smoke` — no secrets needed).
